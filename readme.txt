This is a slide show with left navigation boxes.

== Description ==
I have seen this style of slide show on many sites but haven\'t found a plug in that does it so I made my own. It features a left navigation of title boxes that take up the height of the slide show and a portion of the width (set by you). This slide show is mobile friendly. It is also very light weight. The javascript file only loads on pages that have the short code. It is highly customizable. You can set colors, widths, heights etc. You can even add your own custom CSS to style the slide show. It also includes an auto play feature. 
== Installation ==

1. Upload the unzipped `jtc-slides` file to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the \'Plugins\' menu in WordPress
3. Create a slide show then add slides
3. Place the short code in your content or templates
